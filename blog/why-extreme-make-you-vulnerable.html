    <h1>Why Extremes Make You Vulnerable — and How Balance Builds Strength</h1>
    <p class="lead">Life is about balance. Every strength, when carried too far, becomes a weakness. What makes you admirable can also make you easy to exploit. Stoic wisdom teaches that true power lies in moderation — in the middle ground where self-respect and compassion meet.</p>

   <section aria-labelledby="truth">
     <h2 id="truth">Here’s the truth — and the path forward</h2>

     <p><strong>If you are too nice, people will use you.</strong><br />
     Niceness without boundaries is an invitation for others to take advantage.<br />
     <em>Instead, practice kindness with strength. Let your compassion be guided by self-respect.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too strong, people will try to break you.</strong><br />
     When you show nothing but strength, you become a target.<br />
     <em>Pair your strength with humility. Quiet confidence often disarms those who would challenge you.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too kind, they will take advantage of you.</strong><br />
     Kindness without discernment attracts manipulators.<br />
     <em>Be kind, but wise. True kindness has limits — it uplifts without becoming a doorway for abuse.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too available, they will ignore your value.</strong><br />
     Always being present makes people forget your worth.<br />
     <em>Value your time. Protect your presence, so when you give it, it carries weight.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too honest, you will offend someone.</strong><br />
     Truth matters, but raw bluntness can wound.<br />
     <em>Practice wise honesty — speak the truth in a way that heals, guides, or corrects without unnecessary harm.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too humble, they will overlook you.</strong><br />
     Humility is a virtue, but shrinking yourself is not.<br />
     <em>Stand tall in your worth. Humility shines brightest when paired with confidence.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too forgiving, they will hurt you again.</strong><br />
     Endless forgiveness invites repeated betrayal.<br />
     <em>Forgive, but remember the lesson. Protect your peace by setting boundaries.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too trusting, they will deceive you.</strong><br />
     Blind trust opens the door to lies.<br />
     <em>Trust, but verify. Let trust be earned by actions, not just words.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too patient, they will delay your peace.</strong><br />
     Patience can turn into wasted years if unchecked.<br />
     <em>Be patient with people, but not with neglect. Know when waiting serves you — and when action is required.</em></p>

     <p><strong>If you are too giving, you will end up empty.</strong><br />
     Giving without limits drains your soul.<br />
     <em>Give from your overflow, not from your core. True generosity sustains both the giver and the receiver.</em></p>

     <section aria-labelledby="advice">
     <h2 id="advice">Practical Stoic Advice for Growth</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Set Boundaries</strong> — Compassion without boundaries is weakness. Boundaries transform kindness into strength.</li>
       <li><strong>Balance Strength with Humility</strong> — True power doesn’t shout. It stands firm and steady, unshaken by noise.</li>
       <li><strong>Value Your Time</strong> — Scarcity creates worth. Respect your own time, and others will learn to respect it too.</li>
       <li><strong>Practice Wise Honesty</strong> — Truth must serve wisdom, not vanity. Speak to build, not to destroy.</li>
       <li><strong>Stand Tall in Your Worth</strong> — Humility should not erase you. Be humble, but never invisible.</li>
       <li><strong>Forgive with Discernment</strong> — Forgiveness brings freedom, but wisdom prevents repetition.</li>
       <li><strong>Trust Carefully</strong> — Trust is sacred. Give it slowly, and only to those who prove themselves.</li>
       <li><strong>Be Patient, But Act</strong> — Patience is strength in waiting, but wisdom is knowing when to move forward.</li>
       <li><strong>Give Without Losing Yourself</strong> — Generosity should not empty you. Care for yourself so you can care for others.</li>
     </ul>

   <section aria-labelledby="core-lesson">
     <h2 id="core-lesson">The Core Lesson</h2>
     <blockquote>
     <p><strong>Avoid extremes. Live in balance. Grow with wisdom.</strong> Balance is not dull moderation — it is the sharpening of your virtues so they cannot be turned against you. True resilience comes from harmony: where compassion meets discipline, and where self-respect walks hand in hand with humility.</p>
     </blockquote>
