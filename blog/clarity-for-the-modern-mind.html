    <h1>Clarity for the Modern Mind</h1>

    <p>We live in a world that never stops. Notifications, deadlines, and endless noise compete for our attention every day. Yet, in the middle of all this chaos, the ancient Stoics left us a simple gift: <strong>clarity</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Why Clarity Matters Today</h2>
    <p>Marcus Aurelius ruled an empire, but his private journal was filled with reminders to stay calm, grounded, and focused on what truly matters. If he could find clarity in a world of wars and politics, we too can find clarity in our fast-paced digital age.</p>

    <h2>Three Stoic Practices for Daily Clarity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Morning Reflection:</strong> Begin your day by asking: “What truly deserves my energy today?”</li>
      <li><strong>Pause Before Reacting:</strong> Epictetus taught that events don’t disturb us, but our judgments about them. Take a breath before responding.</li>
      <li><strong>Evening Review:</strong> Before bed, write down what went well and what you could improve tomorrow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Living Stoic Wisdom Every Day</h2>
    <p>Clarity is not just something you read about. It’s something you <em>wear</em> in your choices, your discipline, and your outlook on life. Every decision can be a reflection of Stoic wisdom — simple, strong, and unshaken.</p>
