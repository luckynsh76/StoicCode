      <h2>“The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” – Seneca</h2>
      <p>
        Seneca reminds us that life is not measured by how long it is, but by how fully we live each day.
        The person who lives as if each day were a complete work of art — polished, finished, and complete —
        will never feel cheated by time. Instead of waiting for tomorrow, they find peace in today.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn’t mean rushing or living recklessly. It means bringing presence,
        gratitude, and intention into every day. When you wake up, ask:
        <em>“If this were my last day, what would I want to complete, say, or experience?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By doing so, time no longer feels like an enemy slipping away —
        it becomes a trusted companion, offering you enough space for what truly matters.
      </p>
