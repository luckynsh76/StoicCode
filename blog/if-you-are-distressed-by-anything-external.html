    <title>If You Are Distressed by Anything External — Marcus Aurelius | StoicCode</title>


<blockquote>
    “If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your estimate of it.”
    <br>– Marcus Aurelius
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, reminds us that suffering is rarely caused by events themselves,
    but by the meaning we attach to them. A harsh word, a missed opportunity, or an unexpected challenge does not have the power
    to hurt us — unless we give it that power.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Stoics believed that our freedom lies in controlling our judgments. External events are not fully within our control,
    but how we respond to them is always in our hands. By reframing challenges as opportunities to practice strength and wisdom,
    we reduce distress and live with greater peace of mind.
  </p>

  <h2>Applying This Today</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When criticized — see it as a chance to improve or practice patience.</li>
    <li>When plans fail — recognize that setbacks are part of life’s training.</li>
    <li>When stressed — remind yourself: it’s not the event, but your judgment of it.</li>
  </ul>
